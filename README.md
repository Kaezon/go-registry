# go-registry

## A thread-safe generic registry type for Go applications

Because adding a registry pattern to each project can result in a lot of code duplication,
I decided to write a basic registry that could handle being used across multiple goroutines.

The registry itself accepts empty interface for the values to be registered, so there's no need to
worry about type here. I do realize that this is not necessarily the best answer to making a
general purpose type, so I plan on adding some kind of type checking if I can find a good
way to do so.

## Usage

```go
import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/kaezon/go-registry"
)

var myReg registry.Registry

myReg = registry.New()

newID := myReg.Register(1)

myReg.RegisterName(2, "second")

fmt.Println(myReg.Get(newID))
fmt.Println(myReg.Get("second"))

myReg.Deregister(newID)
myReg.Deregister("second")
```
